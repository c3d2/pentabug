pentabug
========

The pentabug is a small microcontroller soldering project. It's especially suited for young hackers and beginners of all ages. Assembly requires no prior soldering skills and can be accomplished - with a little help for the tricky parts - by children old enough to savely hold a soldering iron (thats about 7 years and up).

At the event [Datenspuren 2012](http://datenspuren.de/2012/ "Datenspuren 2012") nearly 80 kits from our first production run of 100 PCBs have been successfully assembled with just one bug in need of special treatment for a controller mounted the wrong way. Have a look at our [slides in german](/c3d2/pentabug/raw/master/doc/201210_slides_datenspuren.pdf "slides form the Datenspuren 2012 talk") from the accompanying [presentation](http://www.datenspuren.de/2012/fahrplan/events/5074.de.html "pentabug talk announcement"). A video of this session will be available soon.
Meanwhile you can watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTBhXqNR6LY "Dresdner Piratencast Folge 14 - Datenspuren") of Frank and his sons beeing interviewed at our workshop table.
