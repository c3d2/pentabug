# Test firmware

Use this firmware to test all hardware components of a Pentabug. It can test
nearly all hardware features of the device. It offers the following features:

* the left led blinks when no input is present
* receiving an IR signal activates the right led
* pressing the left button sends an IR signal (triggering the right led)
* pressing the right button activates the motor
* each button plays a sound using a different pin of the buzzer
* the pins of the extension board are constantly cycled through (add a
  pentatonic to visualize all but one pin)
